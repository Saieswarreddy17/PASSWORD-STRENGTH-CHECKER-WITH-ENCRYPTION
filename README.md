# PASSWORD-STRENGTH-CHECKER-WITH-ENCRYPTION
📘 Overview

Password Strength Checker with Encryption is a security-focused project designed to evaluate password strength and ensure secure storage using advanced encryption techniques.
The system analyzes user-created passwords in real-time, provides feedback on their strength, and stores them securely after encryption to prevent unauthorized access.

This project was developed as part of the Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering (2024–2025) at BGS Polytechnic, Chikkaballapura under the guidance of Mrs. Archana V (Lecturer, Dept. of CSE).

🎯 Objectives

Analyze and evaluate password strength using rule-based and entropy-based models.

Provide real-time feedback to users to enhance password robustness.

Implement AES and bcrypt encryption for secure password storage.

Ensure data confidentiality and integrity through advanced encryption.

Integrate additional security features such as MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

⚙️ Features:


✅ Password Strength Meter: Real-time evaluation and feedback.
